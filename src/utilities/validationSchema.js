//This file will house the schemas for both resources and categories for our create/edit form. To bring in a simple validation
//implementation, we are going to use  Yup by installing it in our app (npm install yup) see implementation below.

//Yup will work in tandem with Formik, which is an npm package that creates and stores form inputs for each item
//(categoryName, categoryDescription) that we need to capture in our forms. (npm install formik)

/* This is what we need for category POST. We will have inputs for each in the form
    {
        'categoryName': 'Test',
        'categoryDescription': 'Test desc'
    }
